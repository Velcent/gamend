defmodule GamendHost.SearchTest do
  @moduledoc """
  What the search palette offers, and whether those places exist.

  Every row is a promise that a URL leads somewhere, and the catalogue is
  built from three enumerations that this code does not own — the theme's
  navigation and two `Gamend.Content` collections. Any of them can gain a
  shape spelled differently from what is assumed here, and the symptom would
  be a 404 from a search result, which nobody reports as a search bug.

  So the route check is the point: every href is resolved through the real
  router, and a match against the catch-all page fallback counts as a miss,
  because that fallback matches every path ever written.
