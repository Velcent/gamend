# Groups

A group is a persistent community - a clan, a guild, a class - that outlives any session, unlike a lobby or a party. Membership is a row carrying a role, `member` or `admin`, and the group's visibility type decides how new members get in: walk in, ask, or be invited.

## Visibility

| Type | Publicly listed | How you get in |
|---|---|---|
| `public` | yes | Join directly. Idempotent: joining a group you are in returns your membership. |
| `private` | yes | Request to join; an admin approves or rejects. |
| `hidden` | no - never in GET /groups or the `groups` feed | Invite only. A direct join answers 403 `not_joinable`. |

Every path in runs through the same guarded insert: the group's `max_members` cap, the per-user membership cap, and the game's before_group_join hook are all checked under the group's lock regardless of how the member arrived.

## Roles

The creator becomes an admin; everyone else starts as `member`. Admins - all of them, not just the creator - update the group, kick, promote, demote, invite, and handle join requests. Nobody promotes, demotes or kicks themselves.

Leaving keeps the group governed: the last admin walking out promotes the longest-standing member before going, and the creator walking out passes `creator_id` to another admin. When the last member leaves, the group deletes itself - which is why DELETE on a group that still has members is refused with `has_members`.

## Join requests and invites

A request to join a private group is idempotent (asking twice returns the same pending request) and notifies every admin. Admins approve or reject it; the requester can cancel; the outcome lands on the requester's user channel as `group_join_request_approved` or `group_join_request_rejected`.

Invites are the admin's tool, and an admin may only invite **friends** ([/docs/friends](/docs/friends)) - a shared group is not enough, since anyone can join a public group and grant themselves that connection. Blocked pairs are refused. Inviting someone who already has a pending join request approves the request instead of creating an invite. Like party invites, the invite record is independent of its notification, and each player holds at most GAMEND_LIMITS_MAX_GROUP_PENDING_INVITES pending invites.

## Icons and chat

A group's icon is an uploaded image: POST /groups/:id/icon/upload_url returns a presigned upload ticket, and POST /groups/:id/icon confirms the uploaded key - the same two-step flow every upload uses, see [/docs/object-storage](/docs/object-storage). Members talk in group chat, with per-group slowdown and admin mutes - see [/docs/chat](/docs/chat).

Groups also feed the social graph: sharing a group with someone makes them invitable to your party ([/docs/parties](/docs/parties)).

## HTTP API

Endpoints live under `/api/v1/groups` - see [/api/docs](/api/docs). What the spec cannot tell you: **POST /groups/:id/join is three endpoints wearing one path.** On a public group it seats you and returns the membership; on a private group it *creates a join request* and returns that (201); on a hidden group it answers 403. Group invites, unlike party invites, are answered by *invite id* (`/groups/invitations/:invite_id/accept`).

## Realtime events

Members listen on `group:{group_id}`: `updated`, `member_joined`, `member_left`, `member_kicked`, `member_promoted`, `member_demoted`, `member_online`, `member_offline`, `member_updated`, `join_request_approved`, `join_request_rejected` and the three `chat_message_*` events. A group browser listens on the `groups` topic: `group_created`, `group_updated`, `group_deleted` - hidden groups never appear there. Invite and request outcomes for a specific user arrive on their `user:{user_id}` channel (`group_invite_accepted`, `group_invite_cancelled`, `group_join_request_approved`, `group_join_request_rejected`).

## Server scripting

```elixir
{:ok, group} = Gamend.Groups.create_group(user_id, %{"title" => "Crimson Order"})
{:ok, member} = Gamend.Groups.join_group(user_id, group.id)
{:ok, request} = Gamend.Groups.request_join(user_id, private_group_id)
{:ok, member} = Gamend.Groups.approve_join_request(admin_id, request.id)

{:ok, _} = Gamend.Groups.promote_member(admin_id, group.id, target_id)
{:ok, _} = Gamend.Groups.kick_member(admin_id, group.id, target_id)

# One membership check the rest of the system leans on
Gamend.Groups.shared_group_member?(user_a_id, user_b_id)

# Announce to every member - server-side only, deliberately not an endpoint:
# one call fans out a notification per member, so it is a plugin primitive,
# not something a player can trigger.
{:ok, sent} = Gamend.Groups.notify_group(sender_id, group.id, "Raid at 8pm")
```

Hooks fire around create, update, join, leave, kick and delete (`before_group_create`, `after_group_join`, `after_group_deleted`, ...).

## Operations

- The Admin → Groups page (/admin/groups) lists and edits every group, hidden ones included. Admin HTTP mirrors: GET/PATCH/DELETE under /api/v1/admin/groups.
- The public site serves group pages at /groups (browse - hidden groups excluded, like the API listing) and /groups/:id (detail). These pages, the listing API and the feed all sit behind the `list_groups` feature flag.
- Limits: GAMEND_LIMITS_MAX_GROUP_MEMBERS caps a group's `max_members`, GAMEND_LIMITS_MAX_GROUPS_CREATED_PER_USER caps how many groups one user can found, GAMEND_LIMITS_MAX_GROUPS_PER_USER caps memberships per user, and GAMEND_LIMITS_MAX_GROUP_TITLE / GAMEND_LIMITS_MAX_GROUP_DESCRIPTION cap the strings.
