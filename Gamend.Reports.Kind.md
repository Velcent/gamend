# `Gamend.Reports.Kind`
[🔗](https://github.com/appsinacup/gamend/blob/v1.0.7/lib/gamend/reports/kind.ex#L1)

What a report can be about.

Core ships one kind, `"page"` (`Gamend.Reports.Kinds.Page`): something on a
page is broken or wrong. A host adds its own by implementing this behaviour
and listing the module:

    config :gamend_core, :report_kinds, [MyGame.Reports.Word]

A kind owns two things: which **topics** a report on it may pick ("the
translation is wrong", "the audio is wrong"), and how a submitted subject is
**checked and snapshotted** (`c:cast/2`). Everything else — storage, limits,
the admin queue, attachments, the API — is core's and the same for every
kind.

## `cast/2`

Gets the kind-specific params as sent (`"subject"` and `"data"` maps, plus
`"topic"`) and the context (`:user_id`, `:locale`, `:source`). Answers:

    {:ok, %{subject_ref: "ro/1234", subject: %{...}, data: %{...}}}

`subject_ref` is the short key duplicates group on, nil when nothing groups
them. `subject` is the snapshot shown in the queue — take it now, because
what was reported may be renamed or removed by the time anyone reads it.
`data` is the kind's extra fields, already trimmed and capped. An
`{:error, reason}` is shown to the reporter as "check what you entered".

## The web side

`c:ui/0` names the module that draws the kind on `/report` and in the admin
queue (`GamendWeb.Reports.KindUI`). A kind with no UI is API-only: a game
client can file it, and nobody can from the website.

# `cast_result`

```elixir
@type cast_result() :: %{subject_ref: String.t() | nil, subject: map(), data: map()}
```

What `cast/2` answers on success.

# `cast`

```elixir
@callback cast(params :: map(), context :: map()) ::
  {:ok, cast_result()} | {:error, term()}
```

Check and snapshot a submitted subject. See the module doc.

# `description_required?`
*optional* 

```elixir
@callback description_required?(topic :: String.t() | nil) :: boolean()
```

Whether a report must say something in its description.

# `key`

```elixir
@callback key() :: String.t()
```

The kind's key, stored on every report (`"word"`). Lowercase, no spaces.

# `max_attachments`

```elixir
@callback max_attachments() :: non_neg_integer()
```

How many images a report may carry (0 = none).

# `topics`

```elixir
@callback topics() :: [String.t()]
```

The topics a report may pick, in display order. `[]` for none.

# `ui`
*optional* 

```elixir
@callback ui() :: module() | nil
```

The module that draws this kind (`GamendWeb.Reports.KindUI`), nil for API-only.
