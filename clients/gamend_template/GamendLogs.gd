class_name GamendLogs
extends Node

## Ships client log entries to the server, where they land in the same log
## stream as the server's own lines.
##
## [b]Usage[/b] — add as a child of whatever owns the Gamend client, then:
## [codeblock]
## var sink := GamendLogs.new()
## add_child(sink)
## sink.setup("https://your.host", func(): return gamend_api.get_access_token())
## DebugLog.log_added.connect(sink.submit)
## [/codeblock]
##
## Read [member session_id] and send it as the [code]x-gamend-session[/code]
## header on your API calls and as a [code]client_session[/code] socket connect
## param. That is what makes a search for one id return the client's lines and
## the server lines logged while serving that client, interleaved.
##
## [b]Why plain HTTPRequest and not the generated API client[/b]
##
## Because this has to work when the rest of the client does not. It uploads at
## boot before anything is configured or authenticated, it retries while the
## socket is down, and it flushes a previous run's leftovers before the SDK
## exists. A sink that needs a healthy client to report an unhealthy one is a
## sink that goes quiet exactly when it matters.
##
## [b]Crash survival[/b]
##
## The in-memory buffer dies with the process, and a crash is the case worth
## having logs for. So pending entries are mirrored to [code]user://[/code] as
## they arrive and uploaded on the next launch. Set
## [code]logging/file_logging/enable_file_logging[/code] in project settings and
## the engine's own [code]godot.log[/code] — the one with the stack trace — gets
## picked up on the next boot too.

## Emitted after each upload attempt. `ok` is false on any transport or server
## error; `dropped` is the server's running count of entries it knows were lost.

## with it. Read and cleared on the next launch.
const _SPOOL_PATH := "user://gamend_client_logs.ndjson"

## tail-first, because that is where an engine-level crash leaves its trace.
