# `GameServer.Push.DeliveryWorker`
[🔗](https://github.com/appsinacup/game_server/blob/v1.0.7/lib/game_server/push/delivery_worker.ex#L1)

Delivers one push message to one token. One job per token is deliberate:
FCM v1 and APNs are one-request-per-token anyway, and it buys exact
per-token Oban retry/backoff — a half-delivered batch job would re-push
duplicates on retry.

Fires `after_push_sent` on every terminal outcome (delivered, token
disabled, permanent failure, or retries exhausted) — never on a transient
error that will retry.
