# Security & correctness audit — September 2026

Findings from a full read-only audit of the codebase at commit `30648abc6`.
Every item was verified against the source before being listed here.

**70 findings fixed, 4 partially fixed** — each partial is noted inline with what
remains and why. The descriptions stay in the past tense as the record of what was
wrong; line numbers refer to `30648abc6`, so they have since moved.

Verified with both test suites (3,017 web + 27 host), `mix credo --strict` on both
apps, `mix format --check-formatted`, `mix gamend.api.lint`, and a
drop/create/migrate/rollback cycle for the two new migrations.

Three fixes change behaviour on purpose:

- **Logout revokes on every device.** It is `token_version`-based, which is
  account-wide; the endpoint always claimed to invalidate the session and
  previously did nothing at all.
- **Linking an OAuth provider retires the account's device credential.** A device
  id is a bearer credential unaffected by `token_version`; re-attach deliberately
  via `link_device_id/2`.
- **Claiming another account's push token requires the matching `device_id`.**
  Account switching on one device still works; a bare token string no longer moves
  a registration.

One fix needs an operator action: the Compose files no longer carry a
`GAMEND_AUTH_SECRET_KEY_BASE`, they require one. Anyone already running from the
old file should treat that key as compromised, generate a new one, and revoke
sessions.

Status: `[ ]` open · `[x]` fixed · `[~]` partially fixed (the note says what remains)

---

## Critical

- [x] **Compose files ship a published signing key.** `docker-compose.yml:14`,
  `docker-compose.multi.yml:36` hard-code `GAMEND_AUTH_SECRET_KEY_BASE`, and
  Guardian falls back to it (`host_runtime.ex:534`). Anyone reading the repo can
  mint a JWT for any account, admin included.
- [x] **Any signed-in user can delete any passwordless account.**
  `live/user_live/settings.ex:257` reads `conflict_user_id` from the query string;
  `settings/account_tab.ex:436` deletes that user whenever `hashed_password` is nil.
- [x] **Steam checkout lets the client set the price.** `payments.ex:177` uses
  `attrs["amount"]`/`attrs["currency"]`; `payment_controller.ex:123` forwards the
  whole body. Also accepts `status`, `expires_at`, provider transaction fields.
- [x] **Plugin builder runs `mix` in any directory the request names.**
  `admin_live/config.ex:2039` never checks the name against the buildable list;
  `plugin_builder.ex:66` joins it with no basename. Admin session → code execution.

## High

- [x] **Registration accepts a device id.** `accounts.ex:958` writes any submitted
  `device_id`; device login is a plain lookup. Decision: drop device id from
  registration, and clear it when the account is later linked/confirmed by another
  method (link the provider, but that account can no longer use device auth).
- [x] **Steam ticket login uses `ownersteamid`.** `oauth/exchanger.ex:432` should
  use `steamid`; Family Sharing otherwise signs the borrower into the owner's account.
- [x] **OAuth state is not bound to the finishing browser.** `auth_controller.ex:96`,
  `:131`, `:1426`. Enables token theft via the API polling flow and account linking
  onto an attacker's account.
- [x] **Client hook calls reach scheduled job callbacks.** `plugin_manager.ex:143`
  checks only `internal_hooks`; `hooks.ex:386` also blocks `Schedule.registered_callbacks`.
- [x] **Lobby update mass assignment.** `lobby_controller.ex:884` forwards all params;
  `lobbies/lobby.ex:50` casts `host_id`, `hostless`, `password_hash`. Hostless makes
  the lobby permanently unmanageable.
- [x] **Sandbox/TestFlight purchases fulfilled in production.** `providers/apple.ex:135`,
  `providers/google.ex:162` never compare environment with the configured one.
- [x] **Webhook events marked processed before processing.** `payments.ex:383`, `:530`,
  `:544`, `:817`. A handler failure loses the event permanently; the retry is deduped.
- [x] **Fulfilment hook can fire twice.** `payments.ex:1356` resets a completed purchase
  to pending; `:240` reads without a lock. Bundled example hook grants without an
  idempotency key.
- [x] **Malformed WebRTC offer kills the channel.** `user_channel.ex:189` validates only
  the SDP key; `webrtc_peer.ex:148` asserts `:ok =`. Started with `start_link`, so the
  crash skips `terminate/2` — leaks the matchmaking ticket and leaves the user online.
- [x] **Kicked members keep the channel.** `lobby_channel.ex:145`, `group_channel.ex:115`,
  `party_channel.ex:103` never stop the affected member's channel.
- [x] **WebRTC rooms admit non-members by default.** `signaling.ex:170` falls through to
  a late-join branch; `lobbies/lobby.ex:38` defaults it to `true`.
- [x] **Tournament can finish twice.** `tournaments.ex:477` is an unconditional state
  write, reachable from the public show endpoint (`tournament_controller.ex:122`).
  Doubles prize payouts and the next recurrence.
- [x] **Matchmaking sweep holds the only DB writer while calling a plugin.**
  `matchmaking/worker.ex:119`/`:154` + `lock.ex:112` + 60s hook timeout.
- [x] **`mask_secret` reveals ~half of every secret.** `admin_live/config.ex:2836`.
- [x] **Runtime page prints secrets missed by a regex.** `runtime_introspection.ex:189`
  ignores the declared `secret: true` flag; leaks `GAMEND_DB_URL` and the Google Play
  service-account JSON.
- [x] **Ten critical sections take a lock that is a no-op on SQLite.**
  `repo/advisory_lock.ex:8` says so itself; callers should use `Gamend.Lock.serialize/3`.
- [x] **Group can be left with zero admins.** `groups.ex:962` (demote), `:837` (kick)
  have no last-admin guard and no lock. Group becomes permanently unmanageable.
- [x] **Party leader handover is lockless.** `parties.ex:933`. Concurrent leaves orphan
  the party and lock the successor out of creating one (unique index on `leader_id`).

## Medium

- [x] **Metrics endpoint open when no token is set.** `plugs/metrics_auth.ex:56` allows
  every caller. Decision: deny non-loopback when no token is configured.
- [x] **Refresh tokens accepted as access tokens.** `auth/pipeline.ex:14`,
  `auth/optional_pipeline.ex:19`, `channels/user_socket.ex:61` omit the `typ` claim.
- [x] **Logout revokes nothing; deactivation does not either.** `session_controller.ex:160`
  is a no-op; `guardian.ex:41` never checks activation; email change does not bump
  `token_version`; `revoke_all_tokens/1` has no caller.
- [x] **Browser login misses the auth rate bucket.** `rate_limiter.ex:169` matches
  `log-in`, the route is `/users/log_in`.
- [x] **Hidden groups readable without a token.** `router/shared.ex:412`; member listing
  also returns `profile_url`, `is_online`, `last_seen_at`.
- [x] **KV reads default to public across users.** `hooks.ex:1587` returns `:public`;
  `kv_controller.ex:46` and `user_channel.ex:140` take the target id from the caller.
- [x] **Clients can create hostless lobbies.** `lobby_controller.ex:595` rejects only
  boolean `true`; `parties.ex:1280` does not check at all.
- [x] **Party update mass assignment.** `party_controller.ex:776` → `parties/party.ex:46`
  casts `leader_id`.
- [x] **Group `icon_url` settable via PATCH,** bypassing the upload feature gate.
  `group_controller.ex:850` → `groups/group.ex:44`.
- [x] **Google RTDN cannot authenticate and is trusted anyway.** `providers/google.ex:304`
  expects a static bearer header Pub/Sub cannot send; handlers fulfil from the message body.
- [x] **Subscription receipts replayable by a second account.** `payments.ex:330` dedupes
  only on the per-transaction id, never the original.
- [x] **Password-protected lobbies are spectatable.** `lobbies.ex:1596` ignores
  `password_hash`; spectators get chat and the member list.
- [x] **`kv:subscribe` unbounded per socket.** `user_channel.ex:663` — no cap, no key
  length limit.
- [x] **Matchmaking double-queue.** `matchmaking.ex:128` is a bare existence check with
  the join hook between it and the insert; no unique index on queued tickets.
- [x] **Tournament joins can exceed `max_entries`.** `tournaments.ex:273` counts, then
  runs the (fee-charging) hook, then inserts.
- [x] **Quest contention sleeps inside the transaction.** `quests.ex:497` — 25 retries
  with sleeps while holding the single SQLite writer.
- [x] **Ready-check member removal can revive a failed check.** `ready_checks.ex:485`
  does not re-read inside the lock.
- [x] **Presigned S3 uploads do not bind content type.** `storage/s3.ex:67`;
  `uploads.ex:104` never corrects the stored type.
- [x] **Public storage route serves every key.** `router/shared.ex:222` — no prefix
  allowlist; admin uploader writes arbitrary paths.
- [x] **One malformed plugin env var stops the node booting.** `plugin_manager.ex:277`
  asserts `{:ok, cast} =`; declaration callbacks also run with no timeout.
- [x] **Cancelled invite can still be accepted.** `parties.ex:505`, `groups/invites.ex:196`
  never re-validate inside the join; the marking update discards its row count.
- [x] **One group message writes one notification row per member** (default cap 10,000),
  preloading full user rows. `chat.ex:284`, `groups.ex:253`.
- [x] **`Uploads.confirm` accepts `..` segments.** `uploads.ex:86` checks only the prefix.
- [x] **Push token registration reassigns a token to whoever posts it.** `push.ex:122`.

## Low

- [x] **Unclamped leaderboard `limit`;** membership check missing on chat report;
  `String.to_integer` on user input returns 500. `leaderboard_controller.ex:425`,
  `chat_controller.ex:538`, `lobbies.ex:1627`, `groups.ex:509`, `parties.ex:1094`.
- [x] **Unknown channel events unthrottled and logged verbatim.** `lobby_channel.ex:109`
  and five others; mesh signaling relays unbounded payloads.
- [x] **Read cursor not monotonic** (`chat.ex:597`); **chat notifications collide on
  title** (`chat.ex:275`, `notifications.ex:594`) when a group is named to match.
- [x] **Slow-request log records OAuth `code` and `state`.** `request_timer.ex:105`
  redacts password/token/secret but not `code`/`state`.
- [x] **`Settings.read_env` logs the raw value on a failed cast** regardless of
  `secret: true` (`settings.ex:170`); `cast(raw, :atom)` uses `String.to_atom` (`:202`).
- [x] **Client log messages allow ANSI/control characters** into the rotating log file
  (`client_logs.ex:283`); byte cap applied with `String.slice` on graphemes.

## Round 2

Findings the audits reported that the first pass did not carry into this file.
Recorded here in full rather than dropped.

### Security

- [x] **Apple JWS: marker OIDs never checked.** `providers/apple.ex:349,366` validates
  the chain to Apple Root CA - G3 but not the leaf marker `1.2.840.113635.100.6.11.1`
  or the intermediate `1.2.840.113635.100.6.2.1`. Apple issues other ECC certs under
  the same root, so one of those could sign an accepted JWS.
- [x] **Apple bundle id unchecked when unconfigured.** `providers/apple.ex:140` returns
  `:ok` with no bundle id, and `verify_notification/1` never checks `data.bundleId`.
  A JWS-only deployment gets no warning.
- [x] **Hidden lobbies joinable by id, and `/users/:id` leaks `lobby_id`/`party_id`.**
  `user_controller.ex:150`, `lobbies.ex` `do_join` has no `is_hidden` check although
  `show/2` deliberately 404s them.
- [x] **Mesh signaling: any peer may `broadcast_offer`, payload unvalidated.**
  `signaling.ex:265`, `signaling_channel.ex:206`. One peer fans out to every other,
  and `sdp`/`candidate` are relayed without a size or type check.
- [x] **`DELETE /api/v1/me` needs no re-authentication** (`me_controller.ex:349`),
  while changing a password does.
- [x] **Registration `validate` is an unthrottled email-existence oracle.**
  `registration.ex:83` runs `unsafe_validate_unique` on every keystroke.
- [~] **Friend notifications carry an arbitrary `icon_url`,** and one friend can fill
  a victim's `max_notifications_per_user` with distinct titles. `notifications.ex:408`.
  The `icon_url` is length-capped and only reaches people who accepted the friendship;
  the per-sender quota needed to close the exhaustion half is a behaviour decision
  (how many notifications may one friend hold), so it is left for you to set.
- [x] **Stripe success/cancel URLs unvalidated** (`stripe.ex:12`); **Steam `steam_id`
  never compared with `user.steam_id`** (`steam.ex:31`).
- [x] **Client-supplied `access_token` overrides the service credential** on
  `/validate/google` (`providers/google.ex:218`).
- [x] **Admin can demote or delete the last admin, including themselves**
  (`admin/user_controller.ex:61`); the admin "confirmed" toggle writes a field
  `admin_changeset` does not cast, so it silently does nothing.
- [x] **`auth_controller.ex` catch-all logs raw callback params** including `code`
  and `state`, bypassing `filter_parameters`.

### Correctness

- [x] **OAuth session polling sits in the 10/min auth bucket.** `rate_limiter.ex:164`.
  The shipped client polls every 2s for 60s, so any OAuth login slower than ~18s
  fails with a timeout on production defaults.
- [~] **Google pending purchases produce two rows.** `providers/google.ex:94` keys on
  `orderId || token`. The second fulfilment is now blocked by the original-transaction
  ownership check and the `FOR UPDATE` in `fulfill_purchase/2`, so no double grant —
  but the duplicate *row* remains. Fixing it properly means keying Google on the
  purchase token throughout, which changes the dedupe key for existing rows and wants
  a backfill.
- [x] **Refunds are handled coarsely:** `refund.created`/`updated` (including failed
  and cancelled) and partial `charge.refunded` all fully revoke (`payments.ex:1200`).
  Upstream error tuples are echoed to callers (`payment_controller.ex:279`).
- [x] **Chat notifications collide on title.** `chat.ex:275`, `notifications.ex:594`:
  a group or lobby named to match the friend-DM title merges into its slot, and the
  routing metadata is overwritten.
- [x] **`create_party` and `do_join_party` lock different keys** (`parties.ex:320` vs
  `:871`), so a user can end up leading a party they are not in.
- [x] **`leave_group` broadcasts before commit** (`groups.ex:798`), and the cache
  version bump can land pre-commit.
- [x] **`after_draw/2` broadcasts inside the open draw transaction**
  (`tournaments.ex:596`), skipping the module's own `defer/1` machinery.
- [x] **Presence: a disconnect racing a reconnect can leave a live user offline
  forever.** `user_channel.ex` terminate + `presence.ex:48` `last_socket?/1` reads
  the local tracker shard only.

### Performance

- [x] **Plugin hooks still run inside transactions at several sites** with the 60s
  default timeout (`groups/shared.ex`, `lobbies.ex` join, `parties.ex`,
  `tournaments.ex`, `push.ex:593`). Matchmaking was fixed in round 1.
- [x] **Per-user leaderboard rank is an O(N) count with an OR predicate no index
  serves** (`leaderboards.ex:877`); the paged list orders on `inserted_at` while the
  index carries `updated_at`.
- [x] **Signaling re-reads the lobby per subscriber per presence diff**
  (`signaling_channel.ex:395`), and `write_webrtc_config/2` broadcasts without
  preloaded memberships.
- [~] **Group chat notification fanout is still one insert per member.** Round 1 cut
  the preload of every member's full user row, which was the bulk of it, and the whole
  fanout already runs off the request path inside `Gamend.Async.run`. Batching the
  upserts is awkward because each carries an adapter-specific JSON increment, and
  capping the fanout for very large groups would change who gets notified — a product
  decision, not a cleanup.

### Repository hygiene

- [x] **Build artifacts tracked in git:** nine `.br` files under `priv/static/`
  (so `cache_manifest.json.br` shows modified after every build) and an empty
  `apps/gamend_web/game_server_test.db`.
- [~] **Three crash dumps, ~37 MB, untracked but present** in the working tree
  (`erl_crash.dump` and one under each app). Already covered by `.gitignore`, so they
  never reach the repository — this is local disk only. Left in place: they are yours,
  not mine to delete, and they record boot failures from July and August.
- [x] **Three dependency updates available** (oban_web, open_api_spex,
  phoenix_live_dashboard). CI's `check-outdated` job fails on "Update possible".

## Verified sound (do not re-audit)

Wallet debits are a single conditional update. Quest progress uses an optimistic lock
with re-merge; claiming is a conditional transition. Idempotency keys are backed by
unique indexes, and the SQLite adapter maps the violation to a named constraint.
Score submission, wallet and inventory mutation have no client endpoint. Every
`/api/v1/admin/*` route is behind the admin pipeline, and ownership is checked in the
contexts rather than only the controllers. Stripe signature verification uses the raw
body with a timestamp tolerance and constant-time compare. Local storage paths reject
`.`/`..`/`/` per segment. Index coverage across the 68 migrations matches the real query
shapes. Password hashing is Argon2id with a bcrypt fallback and a dummy verify. No user
input reaches `String.to_atom` in channels, the event codec, signaling or KV. Chat
moderation matches via a compiled binary pattern, not regexes.
