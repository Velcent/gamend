/**
 * How many idle players fit in RAM.
 *
 * A connected player who is doing nothing still costs: a transport process, a
 * `user:*` channel process, a Presence entry and a ConnectionTracker
 * registration. That per-socket cost, multiplied by the player count, is the
 * ceiling nothing else in the suite measures — every other scenario opens and
 * closes sockets too quickly for the cost to accumulate.
 *
 * So this opens `SOCKETS` sockets, joins the user topic on each, and holds
 * them for `DWELL` doing nothing but heartbeating.
 *
 *   SOCKETS=5000 DWELL=5m k6 run journeys/ws_idle.js
 *
 * `USERS` is how many device accounts those sockets are spread across, and it
 * exists because the obvious version of this test measures the wrong thing.
 * One account per socket is realistic, but it makes every socket cost a
 * *registration* first — and registration is a write, so the ramp saturates on
 * account creation long before it saturates on sockets. Measured on one core:
 * ~589 registrations/s against a socket cost of ~57 KB, so filling 3 GB of RAM
 * would take ten minutes of signups and never reach the memory ceiling at all.
 * Four load generators produced *fewer* sockets than one, because they were
 * competing for the same write path.
 *
 * With `USERS` well below `SOCKETS` the accounts are created once and shared,
 * and the ramp measures what it is named after. The server must have
 * `GAMEND_LIMITS_MAX_SOCKETS_PER_USER=0` (or a value above `SOCKETS / USERS`),
 * since the default of 20 is a real limit that will otherwise reject the
 * surplus — correctly, and confusingly if you have forgotten it is there.
 *
 *   SOCKETS=20000 USERS=100 DWELL=3m k6 run journeys/ws_idle.js
 *
 * The number to read is not in this summary: it is the server's RSS on the
 * metrics dashboard, divided by SOCKETS. Watch it while this runs. What k6
 * reports here is only whether the connections were accepted and stayed up —
 * a failed join or a dropped socket is the other thing worth knowing.
