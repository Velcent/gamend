/**
 * The connect storm: how fast sockets can be established, and what a mass
 * reconnect costs.
 *
 * `ws_idle.js` answers "how many sockets fit". This answers the question that
 * actually bounds a live game, because holding a connection and establishing
 * one are different costs and only the second one spikes. A deploy, a
 * fly-proxy restart and a mobile carrier handover all produce the same shape:
 * every client coming back inside a few seconds.
 *
 * Three phases, in one run:
 *
 *   connect    open SOCKETS as fast as the generator can, all at once
 *   hold       keep them for HOLD, heartbeating
 *   reconnect  drop every one of them simultaneously, then bring them all back
 *
 * The headline is **connects/s** and the p95 of connect+join, not the
 * plateau — plus whether the reconnect phase is slower than the first connect,
 * which is what says the server degrades under exactly the event it is most
 * likely to meet.
 *
 *   SOCKETS=5000 HOLD=60s k6 run journeys/ws_storm.js
 *
 * Per connection the server does a JWT verify, a per-user socket-limit count,
 * a Presence track, a `users` read, a friends query, a notifications query and
 * five PubSub subscribes. Two of those used to be O(all connections on the
 * node), which made this shape quadratic; they are per-key now (see "Fixes that
 * landed before this round" in the spec), so the pre-fix commit is the natural
 * `report.mjs --diff` baseline.
