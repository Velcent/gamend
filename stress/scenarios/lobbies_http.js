/**
 * The lobby write path: create → read back → transition state → leave.
 *
 * The heaviest ordinary player write in the product, and the one most likely
 * to be the first thing SQLite's single writer serializes. Each step is read
 * back rather than trusted, because a lobby that returns 201 and then cannot
 * be fetched — or whose state silently did not move — is a failure the latency
 * numbers would otherwise report as a success.
 *
 * State is deliberately moved through `POST /lobbies/state`: `state` is
 * server-owned and a `PATCH /lobbies` cannot touch it, so this is the only
 * path a real game uses to start a match.
