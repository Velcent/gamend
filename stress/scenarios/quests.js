/**
 * The quest loop: report an event, read the quest list, claim the reward.
 *
 * Quest progress is server-owned -- no player-facing endpoint advances it -- so
 * the event arrives through `stress_hook`, exactly as a real game server would
 * send it. The three steps are timed apart because they cost wildly different
 * things: the event is an advisory lock around a read-modify-write of one
 * progress row, the list is a cached read of every visible quest, and the claim
 * is the heaviest path in the feature -- a second locked read-modify-write plus
 * a reward grant that writes the wallet and the ledger inside the same
 * transaction. `t_quest_claim` is where a quest regression shows up first.
 *
 * A fresh device user per iteration rather than this VU's cached session, which
 * is what every other scenario uses. Completing a quest sets a
 * per-(user, quest, period) "done" marker in the cache with a one-hour TTL, and
 * a `reset: "repeat"` quest re-arms its row on claim without dropping that
 * marker -- `period_key` for a repeat quest is the constant `"static"`, so the
 * marker never rolls over either. A reused player therefore claims exactly once
 * and then reports events that advance nothing for an hour, which would leave
 * this scenario timing a 409 and calling it a claim.
 *
 * That hour is also why the user has to be new to the *run*, not just to the
 * iteration: device ids are derived from RUN_TAG, VU and iteration, so a second
 * run with the same tag logs in as players who already claimed and are still
 * inside their marker's TTL. Hence the per-run nonce from `setup()`.
 *
 * Paying for a user per iteration also means this scenario is the first to see
 * the SQLite "database busy" 500 that `Gamend.Analytics.insert_day/2` raises
 * out of the login path under concurrent registration, so read a red run here
 * against `POST /login/device` before suspecting quests.
