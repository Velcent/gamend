defmodule Gamend.Accounts.PresenceWriter do
  @moduledoc """
  Coalesces `users.is_online` transitions into one write per flush window.

  `Accounts.set_user_online/1` and `set_user_offline/1` already skip the write
  entirely when the flag is unchanged, so a reconnect or a second socket for an
  already-online player costs nothing. What is left is the storm: N *distinct*
  players connecting at once is N separate transactions, and on single-writer
  SQLite those serialize behind each other.

  This buffers the transitions and flushes them as one `SELECT` (which rows
  would actually change) plus one `UPDATE` per direction, then fires the same
  cache invalidation, broadcasts and hooks the synchronous path fires — once
  per user that really transitioned, never for a no-op.

  ## Buffered state is in ETS, not in the GenServer

  Callers have to read the buffer to decide whether they are making a real
  transition: a player who disconnects inside the flush window must see their
  own pending connect, or the disconnect reads as a no-op and the stale connect
  is what reaches the database. Routing that read through the process would put
  a `GenServer.call` on every socket join — the exact serialization this module
  exists to remove — so the buffer is a public ETS table and the process only
  owns the timer.

  ## Configuration

      config :gamend_core, Gamend.Accounts.PresenceWriter,
        flush_ms: 200      # 0 writes through synchronously

  `flush_ms: 0` is exactly the old behaviour and is what the test environment
  runs, so a test can assert on `is_online` immediately after the call. In
  production the flag lags by at most one window — `StalePresenceSweeper` is
  the backstop that already tolerates far more drift than that, and realtime
  subscribers are told over PubSub from the channel, not from this write.

  If the process is not running (some test setups start a partial tree),
  `flush_ms/0` reports 0 and callers write through rather than dropping the
  transition on the floor.
