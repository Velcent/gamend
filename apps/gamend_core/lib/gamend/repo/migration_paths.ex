defmodule Gamend.Repo.MigrationPaths do
  @moduledoc """
  Resolves every migration directory that belongs to a gamend deployment.

  A host application (the umbrella's `gamend_host`, or a downstream game) runs
  **core migrations plus its own**, and core can be present either as an
  umbrella app or as a dependency. Anything that walks
  migrations — the `host.*` mix tasks, `Gamend.Release`, the admin runtime
  page — must consider the same set, so the list lives here rather than being
  copied per caller.

  Mix and releases locate that set differently, so `all/1` picks one strategy
  or the other rather than merging them: under Mix the directories are paths in
  the project tree, in a release they live inside each application's own
  `lib/<app>-<vsn>/priv`. Returning both would hand Ecto the same migration
  file under two names, and duplicate versions are a hard error.
