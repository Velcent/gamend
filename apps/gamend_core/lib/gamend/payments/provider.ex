defmodule Gamend.Payments.Provider do
  @moduledoc """
  Behaviour for a store adapter — Apple, Google, Steam, or a host's own.

  A host swaps one out through config:

      config :gamend_core, :payment_provider_adapters, apple: MyGame.AppleStub

  That seam existed before this behaviour did, which meant the contract was
  whatever `Gamend.Payments` happened to call, discoverable only by reading it.
  The symptom was `function_exported?(module, :config_status, 0)` guarding
  every call to an optional callback: a runtime probe standing in for a
  declaration.

  ## Required

  `validate_purchase/2` is the one every adapter implements: given the
  attributes a client submitted, confirm with the store that the purchase is
  real, and answer with the normalised fields (`"environment"`,
  `"provider_transaction_id"`, and whatever else the provider knows).

  ## Optional

  The rest are per-provider. Steam has a two-step init/finalize flow that the
  others do not; Apple verifies signed notifications where Google verifies a
  bearer token on the webhook. Declare only what your store actually does —
  `Gamend.Payments` checks before calling, and now checks against this list.
