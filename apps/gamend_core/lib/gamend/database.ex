defmodule Gamend.Database do
  @moduledoc """
  Connection and tuning settings for `Gamend.Repo`.

  The adapter is chosen at **compile** time (see `config/host_config.exs`), so
  `adapter` here is documentation and admin display rather than something a
  restart can change — the app refuses to start on a stale build and says so.

  `GAMEND_DB_URL` and the `POSTGRES_*` family are inherited names: platforms
  provision them, and renaming them would break every managed-database
  attachment.

  # PostgreSQL's own default is `on`: every commit waits for the WAL to reach
  # disk. `off` returns as soon as the commit is in the WAL buffer, which on
  # the load-test harness is +71% on KV writes (3,096/s with fsync, 7,448/s
  # without) for a bounded exposure — an OS or hardware crash can lose the
  # last `wal_writer_delay`-ish window of commits, about 600ms by default.
  #
  # The data stays *consistent* either way; this is not `fsync = off`. Nothing
  # is corrupted, a recent commit is simply not there. That is the right trade
  # for progress, inventory and leaderboard rows and the wrong one for money,
  # so `Gamend.Repo.durable_transaction/2` forces `on` for the length of a
  # payment regardless of what this is set to.
  #
  # Defaulted to `off` rather than to PostgreSQL's `on`, because gamend knows
  # something a general-purpose database does not: which of its writes are
  # money. `Gamend.Repo.durable_transaction/2` puts `on` back for the length
  # of a payment, so the write that must not vanish never rides on this.
  # Everything else is progress a player can re-earn in the seconds before a
  # power cut. Set it to `on` to opt back into PostgreSQL's default.
  #
  # This also brings the two adapters level: SQLite already makes exactly this
  # trade on your behalf with `synchronous = NORMAL`.
