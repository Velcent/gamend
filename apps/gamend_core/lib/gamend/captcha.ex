defmodule Gamend.Captcha do
  @moduledoc """
  Human verification for the unauthenticated browser forms, via
  [Cloudflare Turnstile](https://developers.cloudflare.com/turnstile/).

  Off by default. It guards the two paths that mail an address the submitter
  chose — registration and the magic link — where the abuse is not "too many
  requests from one IP" (the rate limiter in `GamendWeb.LiveHelpers`
  already answers that) but a botnet spending our mail reputation an address
  at a time. Password login is deliberately *not* guarded: a captcha on every
  routine sign-in is friction for returning players, and the credentials are
  their own proof.

  The game SDKs never see this. Registration is browser-only (there is no
  `POST /api/v1/register`), and device login is untouched, so turning it on
  cannot break a shipped Godot or JS client.

  ## Setup

  Create a widget at <https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/turnstile> —
  it is free with no request cap and no card — then set:

      GAMEND_CAPTCHA_ENABLED=true
      GAMEND_CAPTCHA_SITE_KEY=0x4AAA...
      GAMEND_CAPTCHA_SECRET_KEY=0x4AAA...

  Dev and test need none of that: with the keys unset we fall back to
  Cloudflare's published dummy pair, which passes on any host including
  localhost. That keeps the widget on the page in development, so a form that
  only breaks once a captcha is in front of it breaks on the developer's
  machine rather than in production. To exercise the failure path, set
  `GAMEND_CAPTCHA_SECRET_KEY` to the always-fails dummy,
  `2x0000000000000000000000000000000AA`.

  Verifies a widget token with Cloudflare.

  Returns `:ok` when the token is good, `{:error, reason}` otherwise. When
  the captcha is disabled this is `:ok` without a network call, so callers can
  gate unconditionally rather than branching on `enabled?/0` themselves.

  `remote_ip` is passed through to Cloudflare when known; `"unknown"` (what
  `GamendWeb.LiveHelpers.client_ip/1` returns without peer data) is
  omitted rather than sent as a literal.

  A token is single-use and expires after five minutes, so a rejected
  submission needs a fresh one — the caller resets the widget.
