defmodule Gamend.Reports.Notices do
  @moduledoc """
  The notifications reports send: one standing "N reports waiting" alert per
  admin, and a reply to a reporter who had an account.

  Same trick as `Gamend.Chat.Moderation.Notices`: the notification table
  upserts on `(sender_id, recipient_id, title)` and each notice is sent with
  the recipient as its own sender, so an admin keeps one alert whose count
  moves rather than one per report, and a reporter one "reviewed" entry.
