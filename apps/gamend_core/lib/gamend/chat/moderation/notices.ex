defmodule Gamend.Chat.Moderation.Notices do
  @moduledoc """
  The notifications chat moderation sends: alerting admins that a report landed,
  warning a player, telling a player they were muted, and telling a reporter
  what came of their report.

  Every message has a `default_*` function so the admin console can prefill the
  box and let a moderator edit it before sending. The text is the moderator's,
  not core's — these are only sensible starting points.

  All of them go through `Notifications.admin_create_notification/3` with the
  recipient as their own sender. That is the same trick chat notifications use:
  the notification table upserts on `(sender_id, recipient_id, title)`, so a
  player who is muted twice keeps one "You have been muted" entry (re-marked
  unread) instead of collecting a pile, and an admin sees one standing "New
  chat reports" alert rather than one per report.
