defmodule Gamend.Secrets do
  @moduledoc """
  Somewhere to keep a credential that belongs to a *customer*.

  `Gamend.Settings` is the operator's configuration: it comes from the
  environment, and `secret: true` only masks a value on the admin page. That is
  the right shape for a webhook secret the operator sets once. It is the wrong
  shape for a signing certificate a studio uploads, a store API key, or
  anything else a host holds on somebody's behalf — those are per-customer,
  arrive at runtime, and must survive a database dump landing on a laptop.

  ## Where the bytes are, and where the key is

  Rows live in the `secrets` table. The key does not: it is a setting, read
  from the environment, so the ciphertext and the thing that opens it are never
  in the same place. A leaked backup, a read replica, a SQL injection or a
  contractor with database access all yield ciphertext and nothing else.

  What this does **not** protect against is the application being compromised.
  Code running here can decrypt, necessarily — the signer has to. Anything
  claiming otherwise is describing a different product.

  ## The shape

    * **AES-256-GCM**, a fresh random IV per write. GCM because it authenticates
      as well as encrypts: a row edited in the database fails to open rather
      than opening as something else.
    * **The owner and the name are the additional authenticated data.** A
      ciphertext lifted out of one project's row and dropped into another's
      then fails to decrypt, instead of quietly signing the wrong studio's
      build with the wrong certificate. This is the part worth reading twice.
    * **Keys are named.** `key_id` records which key wrote a row, so rotating
      is: add a key, make it current, let `rotate/0` rewrite rows in the
      background. Old rows stay readable in the meantime rather than the whole
      table needing one transaction.
    * **The fingerprint is an HMAC**, not a digest. A plain digest of a short
      secret is a dictionary away from the secret, and this column is shown on
      a page.

  ## Configuration

      GAMEND_SECRETS_KEYS="v2:<base64>,v1:<base64>"

  Comma-separated `id:key` pairs, each key 32 bytes base64-encoded. **The first
  is current** and is what new writes use; the rest exist so rows written
  before a rotation can still be read. Generate one with:

      :crypto.strong_rand_bytes(32) |> Base.encode64()

  Unset, every call answers `{:error, :no_key}`. That is deliberate: a host
  that has not configured a key should fail loudly on the first write rather
  than store a credential in a way it cannot honour later.
