defmodule Gamend.UnknownUserFkTest do
  @moduledoc """
  Writing a row that points at a user who does not exist.

  These all used to raise `Ecto.ConstraintError`, so an admin request naming a
  stale id — or a plugin passing one — came back 500. The schemas did declare
  `foreign_key_constraint(:user_id)`, but SQLite (the default adapter) does not
  report *which* constraint an INSERT violated, so Ecto cannot match the
  declaration and raises instead of returning a changeset. The adapter's own
  docs say `foreign_key_constraint/3` "may not work at all" there.

  The contexts check first now. The constraint stays declared: it is still the
  thing that makes the row impossible, and on Postgres it still reports.
