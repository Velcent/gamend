  Somewhere to keep a customer's credential.

  Core has never stored one: `Gamend.Settings`' `secret: true` only masks a
  value in the admin UI, and those values come from the environment — they are
  the operator's, not a customer's. A host that signs builds, publishes to a
  store or calls somebody's API on their behalf needs a different thing, and
  every fork that grows one would otherwise invent it again.

  Both adapters, as ever: no Postgres-only types, every index named.
