defmodule GamendWeb.Api.V1.ClientLogController do
  @moduledoc """
  Ingest for logs from the game client, and the policy that tells a client what
  to send.

  Optional auth, deliberately. The entries worth having most are the ones from
  before a client has a token — a failed login, a boot that never got as far as
  the network — and requiring a bearer token would drop exactly those. A batch
  from an authenticated caller is bound to that user; an anonymous one is bound
  to its device, and adopted by the user when the same run signs in. See
  `Gamend.ClientLogs`.

  ## Transport

  HTTP rather than the user channel the client already holds open, because the
  interesting failures are the ones where that channel is down. A batch that
  can only be delivered over a working socket is a batch that cannot explain a
  broken one.
