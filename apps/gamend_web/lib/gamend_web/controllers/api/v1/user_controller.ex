  # `serialize_brief/1` is built for party, lobby and friend member lists, where
  # the caller is already in the room with the user. These two endpoints are
  # public and unauthenticated, so handing back the same payload gives a
  # name-prefix search the whole game-defined metadata map. For a game that
  # keeps position, destination or study state in there, that is a stranger
  # tracking a named player with no account.
  #
  # Metadata is therefore default-deny here, and a host opts individual
  # sections back in through :public_user_metadata_keys.
  # `profile_url` goes with the metadata, for the same reason and one of its
  # own: it is set from an upload *or* imported verbatim from a Google, Discord,
  # Steam or Facebook profile, which means it is frequently a photograph of the
  # account holder. Handing that out from an unauthenticated endpoint, keyed to
  # a name prefix, is the picture and the name together.
  #
  # No lobby or party id either. A lobby id is enough to join a lobby or walk
  # into a WebRTC signaling room, so "which room is this player in" next to a
  # name search was the discovery half of several other problems. The fields
  # went out blank for a while, carrying nothing; now they are gone.
  # Authenticated callers get membership from the lobby, party and channel
  # APIs, which check the caller's relationship to it.
