defmodule GamendWeb.ErrorHTML do
  @moduledoc """
  Error pages for HTML requests.

  Phoenix's default renders the status message as plain text — a 404 was nine
  bytes reading "Not Found", which looks like the whole site is broken rather
  than one URL being wrong, and gives a reader nowhere to go but Back.

  `render_errors` is configured `layout: false`, so these templates are whole
  documents. That is the right shape for them anyway: this page has to render
  when something has already failed, so it depends on no layout, no asset
  bundle and no assign the endpoint might not have set. Styling is inline —
  the browser CSP permits inline styles but not inline scripts, so there is
  also no JS.

  Locale-aware where it can be: the `LocalePath` plug has usually already run
  and set the gettext locale, so the copy is translated and the links keep the
  reader's language prefix. Where it has not (an error early in the pipeline),
  it falls back to the default locale rather than raising — the one thing an
  error page must never do is fail.

  Extra places to send a lost reader, beyond Home.

  Core has no idea what a given host's pages are called — `/vocabulary` means
  nothing to a Gamend server that is not this one — so the list is empty by
  default and each host names its own:

      config :gamend_web, :error_page_links, [
        %{label: "Vocabulary", path: "vocabulary"},
        %{label: "Play", path: "play"}
      ]

  `path` is relative and gets the reader's locale prefix, so from `/fr/nope`
  the links stay French. Labels are looked up in the host's gettext catalogue
  at render time; they resolve when the msgid already exists there (these are
  navigation labels, so it generally does) and fall back to the literal
  otherwise.

  An `:error_page_links` assign wins over the application env, so a caller (or
  a test) can pin the list for one render without touching global config.
