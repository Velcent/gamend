defmodule GamendWeb.Features do
  @moduledoc """
  Toggles for the public, unauthenticated surface.

  Each flag gates a listing endpoint *and* the matching realtime channel and
  browser page together, so switching one off closes the whole route rather
  than leaving a second way in. All default to on; a deployment that does not
  want third parties browsing or scraping its data turns off what it does not
  need.

  `web_groups`, `web_chat`, `web_tournaments` and `web_store` are
  website-only: they close a page and every link to it (`drop_disabled/1`)
  and leave the API to the game client, so a host can park a feature on the
  site without breaking the game.

  Read through `GamendWeb.Plugs.FeatureGate`, which 404s a disabled route.
