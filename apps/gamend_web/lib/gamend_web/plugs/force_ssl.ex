defmodule GamendWeb.Plugs.ForceSSL do
  @moduledoc """
  Redirects plain HTTP to HTTPS when `GamendWeb.Tls`'s `:force` is on.

  A host on this stack binds port 80 itself, so without a redirect every page
  has a live plain-HTTP twin that a crawler will index — Search Console then
  reports `http://` URLs alongside the real ones.

  ## Why this is a plug and not endpoint config

  Phoenix's `:force_ssl` endpoint option cannot express a runtime setting:
  `Phoenix.Endpoint` reads it with `Application.compile_env/2` and decides
  **at compile time** whether to insert `Plug.SSL` into the endpoint. Setting
  it from `runtime.exs` — which is where every other setting on this stack
  comes from — writes a key nothing ever reads again, so the redirect silently
  never happens no matter what `GAMEND_TLS_FORCE` says.

  `Plug.SSL` itself still does the work; only the decision to call it is ours.

  HSTS is left to `GamendWeb.Plugs.SecurityHeaders`, which already sends it on
  every HTTPS response — `hsts: false` here just avoids a duplicate header.

  Plugged straight after `GamendWeb.Plugs.AcmeChallenge` so a Let's Encrypt
  HTTP-01 renewal is answered before this can redirect it, rather than relying
  only on the path exclusion below.
