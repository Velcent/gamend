      # credentials header, and the request was blocked with nothing in it
      # explaining why. (Corsica sends the bare `*` from a dedicated clause when
      # it runs as a plug with `origins: "*"`, so the credentials-aware path
      # documented for that combination never runs here.)

      # Wildcard-without-credentials is also the safer default: a token in an
      # `Authorization` header still works from any origin, which is how game
      # clients authenticate, while cookies stay unusable cross-origin. Naming
      # origins in `GAMEND_HTTP_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` is what opts into cookies.
