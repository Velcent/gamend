defmodule GamendWeb.Plugs.SecurityHeaders do
  @moduledoc """
  Sets baseline security headers on every response.

  These headers apply to all requests — static assets, API endpoints, and
  browser pages alike. Router-level pipelines may override individual headers
  (e.g. `Content-Security-Policy`) for specific scopes.

  Headers set:

  | Header | Value | Purpose |
  |--------|-------|---------|
  | `X-Content-Type-Options` | `nosniff` | Prevents MIME type sniffing |
  | `X-Frame-Options` | `SAMEORIGIN` | Prevents clickjacking |
  | `Referrer-Policy` | `strict-origin-when-cross-origin` | Limits referrer leakage |
  | `Permissions-Policy` | (restrictive) | Limits browser feature access |
  | `Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy` | `same-origin` | Prevents cross-origin embedding |
  | `X-Permitted-Cross-Domain-Policies` | `none` | Prevents Flash/PDF cross-domain |

  In production, the `x-request-id` response header is stripped to avoid
  leaking internal correlation identifiers. The request ID remains available
  in `conn.assigns[:request_id]` for logging.
