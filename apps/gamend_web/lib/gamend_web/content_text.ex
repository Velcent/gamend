defmodule GamendWeb.ContentText do
  @moduledoc """
  Translates the user-facing text stored on quests, leaderboards and
  tournaments.

  The database stores **one** string per field — the source text, in English.
  It never stores a translation. Quests and leaderboards used to keep a
  per-locale copy in `metadata["titles"][locale]`, which drifted exactly like
  the per-locale theme files did: editing the title left 29 stale copies and
  nothing said which were stale. `mix gamend.content.migrate_metadata` lifts
  any of those into the PO files.

  Translations come from the `content` domain, whose msgids
  `mix gamend.content.extract` reads back out of the database. That covers
  both origins:

    * defined in code (a plugin's `after_startup`, a seed) — extraction picks
      the row up, and a translator fills it in like any other string. A plugin
      cannot use `dgettext_noop` even if it wanted to: it is a separate Mix
      project with no `:gettext` dependency, so the macro is not in scope;
    * typed in the admin UI — extractable too, but until someone translates it
      `dgettext` falls back to the stored string, so it renders in whatever
      language it was written in.

  The one thing never to do is translate on the way *in*:

      create_quest(title: gettext("Welcome aboard"))   # freezes one locale

  That stores whichever locale the server booted in, for every user. Store the
  source, translate on the way out — which is what this module is for.

  Applied where a player-facing LiveView assigns its records. **Admin pages
  deliberately do not use it**: an admin editing a quest has to see the string
  that is actually stored, or they will "fix" a translated title and overwrite
  the source.

  ## Placeholders

  A repeat quest's title carries `%{n}` (see `Gamend.Quests.resolve_counter/2`)
  and that has to survive until *here*, because the msgid is the string with
  the placeholder in it. So the number is passed to Gettext as a binding and
  interpolated into the **translation**. Substituting it earlier looked right
  in English and quietly broke every other locale: "Treasures x 3" matches no
  msgid, so the lookup missed and the card fell back to English — while the
  bare msgid reaching `dgettext/3` without bindings logged a
  `missing Gettext bindings: [:n]` error on every anonymous page view.
