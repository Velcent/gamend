defmodule GamendWeb.FileLogHandler do
  @moduledoc """
  Persists all logs to a rotating file so history survives restarts — the
  admin log buffer (`GamendWeb.AdminLogBuffer`) is in-memory only and is
  lost on redeploy/restart.

  Disabled unless a path is configured. Runs *alongside* the default stdout
  handler, so `fly logs` still receives everything. On a Fly deploy, point it at
  the mounted volume.

      config :gamend_web, GamendWeb.Observability, log_file_path: "log/dev.log"

  Backed by OTP's built-in `:logger_std_h`, which handles size-based rotation
  (`max_no_bytes` per file, `max_no_files` kept). Defaults to 10MB x 5 files.

  ## Where the settings come from

  Every knob is a declared `GamendWeb.Observability` setting, so it is read
  through `Gamend.Settings.get/2` — which looks at
  `Application.get_env(:gamend_web, GamendWeb.Observability)` and then the
  compiled default. **Nothing else.** In particular `get/2` does not read the
  environment: a host that wants env-driven settings has to splat
  `Gamend.Settings.from_env/0` into its own `runtime.exs`, and a host that does
  not gets app config only, however the variables are set.

  | setting | config key | env (only via `from_env/0`) |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | path | `:log_file_path` | `GAMEND_OBSERVABILITY_LOG_FILE_PATH` |
  | level | `:log_file_level` | `GAMEND_OBSERVABILITY_LOG_FILE_LEVEL` |
  | bytes per file | `:log_file_max_bytes` | `GAMEND_OBSERVABILITY_LOG_FILE_MAX_BYTES` |
  | files kept | `:log_file_max_files` | `GAMEND_OBSERVABILITY_LOG_FILE_MAX_FILES` |

  Both columns used to read differently — a flat `:gamend_web, :log_file` key
  and a bare `LOG_FILE_PATH`, from before these moved behind
  `Gamend.Settings`. Neither has resolved to anything since, and because an
  unconfigured path disables the handler *silently*, a host carrying the old
  line logged to stdout only and lost every run to terminal scrollback. The
  polyglot host was doing exactly that, undetected, until a client-side bug
  needed the server's account of a run and there was none to read.

  A misconfigured path is still silent by design — this handler must never be
  the reason a boot fails — so when adding a knob here, prefer one whose
  absence is visible in `GamendWeb.Observability` rather than only at runtime.
