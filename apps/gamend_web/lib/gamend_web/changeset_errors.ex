defmodule GamendWeb.ChangesetErrors do
  @moduledoc """
  The one way a controller answers a failed changeset.

  Imported into every controller by `use GamendWeb, :controller`, so the answer
  is `unprocessable(conn, changeset)` and there is nothing to look up.

  ## Why this exists

  Forty-six call sites serialized changeset errors by hand, in three different
  payload shapes under three different envelope keys. A client could not write
  one error handler:

    * `traverse_errors(cs, & &1)` — seventeen sites — left the raw
      `{msg, opts}` tuple in the payload. `Jason` has no encoder for tuples, so
      every one of those raised `Protocol.UndefinedError` and the request came
      back **500**, on endpoints whose own OpenAPI operation documented a 422.
      Nothing caught it because not one of those branches had a test.
    * `traverse_errors(cs, fn {msg, _opts} -> msg end)` — twenty-two sites —
      shipped the raw msgid, so a client read the literal
      `"should be at most %{count} character(s)"` with the count still in it.
    * Seven sites interpolated with a hand-rolled `Regex.replace/3` and were
      correct, but untranslated.

  The envelope varied independently: `errors:` on twenty-three, `error:` on
  nine, `details:` on one.

  ## The shape

      %{error: "validation_failed", errors: %{field => [message, ...]}}

  Messages are interpolated **and** translated, through
  `GamendWeb.CoreComponents.translate_error/1` — the same function the
  LiveView forms use, so an API client and a form reader are told the same
  thing in the same language. Gettext falls back to the msgid when a locale has
  no translation, so English is unaffected.

  `mix gamend.api.lint` (R10) rejects a new hand-rolled `traverse_errors` in a
  controller.
