defmodule GamendWeb.ChannelEvents do
  @moduledoc """
  Handling every channel shares: an event it does not recognise, and a member
  whose presence or profile changed.

  Seven channels each answered an unknown event with the same reply and a debug
  line differing only in its label, and five carried a private copy of the
  `truncate_event/1` that bounds that line. Lobby and party pushed member
  presence identically, and lobby, party and group pushed a member's updated
  profile identically — apart from the wire event names, which are part of each
  channel's documented contract and so are passed in rather than unified.

  The channel callbacks still exist in each channel (a `handle_info/2` clause
  cannot be shared without a macro that would fight the catch-all clauses for
  ordering); they delegate here, the final `handle_info/2` through
  `other_info/2`.

  Replies to an event the channel does not handle.

  Replying rather than crashing matters: a crashed channel takes every broadcast
  it carried with it, and a client cannot tell a dead channel from a quiet one.
  `context` names assigns to include in the debug line, as `[label: assign_key]`.

  Logged at debug, with the name bounded by `truncate/1`. A frame allows a
  128 KB event name and the channels rate-limit their known events only, so a
  warning-level line carrying the name let one socket write unbounded,
  attacker-chosen text into the rotating log and the admin buffer.
