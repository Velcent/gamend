defmodule GamendWeb.LogFilters do
  @moduledoc """
  Primary `:logger` filters for crash reports that are noise, not defects.

  A **primary** filter (rather than a per-handler one) because these reports are
  worthless everywhere: console, file log and the admin Logs buffer alike.
  Filtering once at the source also keeps them from consuming the admin buffer,
  which is a fixed-size ring — a steady stream of noise evicts the real entries
  long before anyone reads them.

  ## The TLS client alerts

  When a client closes a TLS connection by sending a `user_canceled` alert
  (Safari and iOS do this routinely on navigation away), Erlang's `:ssl` sends
  the owning process `{:ssl_error, socket, {:tls_alert, {:user_canceled, _}}}`.
  Thousand Island turns that straight into `{:stop, reason, state}`:

      def handle_info({msg, raw_socket, reason}, {socket, state})
          when msg in [:tcp_error, :ssl_error] do
        {:stop, reason, {socket, state}}
      end

  The reason is neither `:normal` nor `:shutdown`, so OTP logs a full
  `gen_server terminate` crash report with the entire socket struct inlined —
  one per closing client. Note this path ignores Thousand Island's
  `silent_terminate_on_error` option, which only covers the *handler-return*
  error path, so there is no configuration knob that suppresses it.

  ## Why an allowlist rather than "drop all TLS alerts"

  Most TLS alerts are worth seeing. `handshake_failure`, `unknown_ca` and
  `certificate_expired` on a server that terminates TLS itself (this one binds
  443 directly — no proxy) are how a broken or expired certificate announces
  itself. Dropping every `:tls_alert` would silence the one class of TLS error
  that actually needs a human. Only alerts that mean "the peer went away or
  never spoke TLS" are listed.

  ## The corruption alerts

  Binding 443 straight to the internet puts every scanner, broken middlebox and
  half-open mobile connection in front of the TLS stack, and each one costs a
  full crash report:

    * `bad_record_mac` — a record failed its authentication check, in either
      direction (`decryption_failed`, `record_type_mismatch`). Bytes were
      altered, truncated or replayed in transit; nothing on this side can
      repair a network path that mangles packets.
    * `unexpected_message` carrying `unsupported_record_type` — the byte where
      a TLS content type belongs is not one of the four legal values (20, 21,
      22, 23). Whatever connected is not speaking TLS at all.

  Both are peer faults by construction. A genuine misconfiguration on this side
  fails during the *handshake*, as one of the alerts deliberately kept above.

  ## The non-alert noise

  `Bandit.TransportError` "Unable to obtain conn_data" is a socket that died
  between accept and first read: `:inet.peername/1` answers `:einval` because
  there is no longer a connection to name. Scanners that connect and instantly
  reset produce a steady trickle of these.

  Bandit's "Connection that looks like TLS received on a clear channel" is a
  client speaking TLS to port 80. This app serves 80 only to redirect and to
  answer ACME challenges, so that is the client's mistake, not a fault here.

  Bandit's own protocol-error lines — malformed request lines, forbidden HTTP/2
  headers, bodies cut short — are deliberately *not* handled here. They are
  switched off at the source, `log_protocol_errors: false` on both listeners in
  `GamendWeb.HostRuntime`, because every one of them is the peer's fault by
  construction and matching their message strings here would be a patch on top
  of a patch. The dead-socket rule below still applies to a host that builds
  its own endpoint config and leaves Bandit's default in place.
