  A tiny runtime SVG loader for hero-style icons stored under

  Usage:

      <.dynamic_icon name={"hero-book-open"} class="w-5 h-5" />

  - Loads the raw SVG at runtime from priv/static/heroicons/<name>.svg
  - Caches successful reads in `:persistent_term` (read-only, no owner)
  - Falls back to the compiled `<.icon>` component when the SVG file is

  # destroyed by the end of that request: every later render re-read every icon
  # from disk, and a process that saw the table exist then had it vanish before
  # its lookup crashed with "the table identifier does not refer to an existing
  # ETS table". `:persistent_term` has no owner and outlives every process.
  # Icons are immutable and few, so each one is written exactly once.
  # The absent file is cached too, as `:absent`. Only caching hits made the
  # miss free to look up but never free to *repeat*: `priv/static/heroicons/`
  # does not ship in this build, so every name missed, nothing was ever
  # written, and each render re-ran the lookup for every icon on the page --
  # 139 of them on the home page. Each one is a `:code.priv_dir/1` round trip
  # through the single `code_server` process plus a failing `File.read`, so
  # the cost did not divide across schedulers: measured on an M1, the miss
  # path runs ~100k/s on one process and ~79k/s on eight, which put a
  # node-wide ceiling of roughly 600 renders/s on the page no matter how many
  # cores it was given. The fallback markup was always what rendered; only
  # the lookup was repeated.
