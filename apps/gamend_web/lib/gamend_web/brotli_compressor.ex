defmodule GamendWeb.BrotliCompressor do
  @moduledoc """
  A `Phoenix.Digester.Compressor` that shells out to `brotli`.

  Add it beside the gzip one and `mix phx.digest` writes a `.br` next to every
  `.gz`; `GamendWeb.Endpoint` serves them when `:brotli_static` is on.

      config :phoenix, :static_compressors, [
        Phoenix.Digester.Gzip,
        GamendWeb.BrotliCompressor
      ]

  Which files are compressed is `:phoenix, :gzippable_exts` — one list, so a
  host that adds an extension (a Godot web export's `.wasm`, say) gets both
  encodings from the one setting rather than two lists that drift.

  ## Shelling out

  Quality 11 is a build-time cost paid once per asset, and the `brotli` CLI is
  present in the Docker image. There is no NIF here on purpose: an Elixir
  brotli dependency would need a compiler on every machine that builds assets,
  to save a `System.cmd` that runs a few dozen times in a release build.

  Every failure mode returns `:error`, which makes the digester skip the file
  and keep the gzip: a missing binary, a non-zero exit, or output that came out
  no smaller than the input — the last of which is why the size check is in the
  match rather than an `if` after it.
