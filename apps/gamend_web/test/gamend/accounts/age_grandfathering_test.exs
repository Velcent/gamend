defmodule Gamend.Accounts.AgeGrandfatheringTest do
  @moduledoc """
  The backfill that protects existing players.

  `AddUserAgeFields` stamps `grandfathered_at` on every row that exists when it
  runs, and `AgePolicy` reads that as "unknown, but do not restrict yet". If the
  statement silently does nothing — a timestamp format the adapter cannot read
  back, a column that stayed NULL — the symptom is not an error. It is every
  current player losing chat, purchasing and their leaderboard identity on
  deploy.

  A fresh test database has no pre-existing rows, so the migration's own backfill
  touches nothing here. These tests run the same statement against a row that
  does exist, which is what makes the format portable rather than assumed.
