defmodule Gamend.QuestConcurrencyTest do
  @moduledoc """
  Quest progress is a read-modify-write on a JSON map, so two events landing
  together on one row can each read the same map and the second write can drop
  the first's increment.

  It used to be serialized with a per-(user, quest) advisory lock. It is now
  guarded by `lock_version`: the loser of a race matches no row, re-reads and
  merges again. The tests below are what says that holds — a lost increment is
  invisible from the outside, which is exactly why it needs asserting.

  The IMMEDIATE-transaction check stays because the rest of the app still
  takes transactions under contention: on SQLite a DEFERRED transaction that
  reads before it writes has to upgrade its lock, and SQLite answers a
  contended upgrade with `SQLITE_BUSY` immediately — `busy_timeout` only
  covers *waiting* for a lock, never *upgrading* one.
