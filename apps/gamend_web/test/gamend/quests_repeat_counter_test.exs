defmodule Gamend.QuestsRepeatCounterTest do
  @moduledoc """
  A `repeat` quest is one definition and one row that re-arms forever, so
  nothing about it says which run the player is on. `%{n}` in the title is how
  it does: the card reads "Treasures x 1", then "Treasures x 2".

  The number has to be worked out where a definition meets a player's row —
  writing it into the stored title would show every player the same one — and
  it has to stay *out* of the title until the string has been translated, since
  the title with the placeholder in it is the msgid. Both are pinned here.
