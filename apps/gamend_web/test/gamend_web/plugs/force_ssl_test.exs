  `GAMEND_TLS_FORCE=true` used to do nothing at all: it was wired to Phoenix's
  `:force_ssl` endpoint option, which is read with `Application.compile_env/2`
  and so is decided when the endpoint is compiled, not when it boots. Every
  page kept a live plain-HTTP twin and Search Console indexed `http://` URLs.

  These pin the redirect to the runtime setting, and pin the two paths that
  must survive it.
