  The palette's markup in the page.

  Three things it must get right, each of which has a way of going wrong that
  nothing else would catch:

    * exactly one dialog. It is rendered outside both navs for a reason, and
      a second copy would give two elements the same id and the JS the wrong
      one.
    * `phx-update="ignore"`. Without it morphdom re-sends the layout on every
      LiveView diff, and an open dialog has no `open` attribute in that
      markup — the palette would shut itself on any page with a ticking clock.
    * nothing at all when search is off.
