  `:quest_lock_filter` — the host's "you can see this, but it is not yours to

  The state the page could not express before: `host_visible/2` keeps a quest or
  drops it, and `hidden` is a column that draws "???" over the very title a
  premium offer is made of. A quest shown with its real name and live progress
  and NO claim button is the third thing, and the failure it prevents is a
  Claim the server then refuses.
