defmodule GamendWeb.SingleDeliveryTest do
  @moduledoc """
  One PubSub broadcast, one push.

  `Phoenix.Channel.Server` subscribes a channel process to its own topic on
  the endpoint's PubSub (`Gamend.PubSub`) right after `join/3` returns. The
  lobby, party, group, lobbies and groups channels used to subscribe to that
  same topic themselves inside `join/3` as well — `Phoenix.PubSub` is a
  duplicate registry, so the process was registered twice and every
  `handle_info` ran twice: a Godot client saw `state_changed` (and `updated`,
  `user_joined`, …) arrive twice per event. Reported from the Godot SDK; the
  SDK was faithful, the server pushed twice.

  Each test broadcasts once on the channel's own topic — the same
  `Phoenix.PubSub.broadcast/3` the core `broadcast_*` helpers use — and
  refutes a second push.
