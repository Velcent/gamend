  @moduledoc """
  Keeps `GamendWeb.RealtimeEvents`' `pb:` flag honest against what
  `GamendWeb.EventCodec` actually encodes.

  The registry is the published contract: it is what the admin Runtime page
  renders as a "pb+json" or "json" badge per event, and what a client author
  reads to decide whether to expect a binary frame. Nothing checked it. The two
  could disagree in either direction, and both directions are silent:

    * `pb: true`, no mapping — the client waits for a binary frame that never
      comes, or worse, was written to decode one and gets JSON instead.
    * `pb: false`, mapping exists — the client treats the event as JSON and
      fails to parse the binary frame the server actually sends.

  The second is not hypothetical: `chat_muted` and `chat_unmuted` were declared
  `pb: false` while `EventCodec` mapped both.

  `realtime_events_drift_test.exs` already keeps the registry's *event list* in
  sync with the source. This covers the column that test does not read.
