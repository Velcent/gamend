  @moduledoc """
  Realtime timestamps are named after the REST field they mirror.

  JSON sends `deadline_at` as an ISO 8601 string; protobuf, which has no
  timestamp type, sends the same instant as `deadline_at_ms`. Strip `_ms` and
  you have the REST name — which is what lets a client map one onto the other
  without a lookup table.

  `deadline_ms` broke that rule for two messages, and nothing caught it: a
  client reading the name it expected got a silent zero, and the party panel's
  countdown was blank for as long as it existed. Hence a test — the cost of the
  convention slipping is invisible, so it has to be visible here.
