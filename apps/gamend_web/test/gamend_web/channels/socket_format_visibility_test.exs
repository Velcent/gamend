defmodule GamendWeb.SocketFormatVisibilityTest do
  @moduledoc """
  The server must be able to answer "is this client on protobuf or JSON".

  It could not before. `ws_format` was assigned on connect and read by
  `ChannelPush`, and that was the whole of its life — nothing logged it, the
  connection tracker did not carry it, and the admin pages could not show it.

  That matters because of one silent failure: a client asking for protobuf on a
  **v1** socket gets JSON instead, with no error on either side. Everything
  keeps working — just uncompressed, with every binary decoder on the client
  idle — so without this there is no way to tell the two apart from the server.
