defmodule Gamend.Jobs do
  @moduledoc ~S"""
  Durable background jobs, backed by Oban.

  Use this from your hooks to run work that must survive a restart, retry on
  failure, or happen later — things `Gamend.Async` (best-effort, in-memory)
  cannot guarantee.

  Jobs are persisted in the same database as the rest of your data (Postgres or
  SQLite), executed with retries and backoff, and observable from the admin
  panel.

  ## Enqueue a hook to run in the background

      # Run `on_welcome_email` now, retried on failure
      Gamend.Jobs.enqueue_hook(:on_welcome_email, %{"user_id" => user.id})

      # Run it in 24 hours (delayed job)
      Gamend.Jobs.enqueue_in(24 * 60 * 60, :on_trial_reminder, %{"user_id" => user.id})

  The callback receives the args map you passed. **Args are stored as JSON**, so
  keys come back as strings and values must be JSON-encodable:

      def on_welcome_email(%{"user_id" => user_id}) do
        # ...
        :ok
      end

  Returning `{:error, reason}` from the callback makes the job retry with
  backoff; `:ok`/`{:ok, _}` completes it.

  ## Recurring work

  For cron-like recurring jobs use `Gamend.Schedule` (also durable, built on
  top of this module).

  ## RPC safety

  Any hook enqueued through `enqueue_hook/3` is automatically protected from
  client RPC — a client cannot invoke a job callback directly.


  **Note:** This is an SDK stub. Calling these functions will raise an error.
  The actual implementation runs on the Gamend.
