defmodule Gamend.Parties do
  @moduledoc ~S"""
  Context module for party management.

  A party is a pre-lobby grouping mechanism. Players form a party before
  creating or joining a lobby together.

  ## Usage

      # Create a party (user becomes leader and first member)
      {:ok, party} = Gamend.Parties.create_party(user, %{max_size: 4})

      # Leader invites a friend or shared-group member by user_id
      {:ok, _notification} = Gamend.Parties.invite_to_party(leader, target_user_id)

      # Target accepts the invite
      {:ok, party} = Gamend.Parties.accept_party_invite(target, party_id)

      # Or declines
      :ok = Gamend.Parties.decline_party_invite(target, party_id)

      # Leave a party (a leader hands it over; the last member out disbands it)
      {:ok, _} = Gamend.Parties.leave_party(user)

      # Party leader creates a lobby — all members join atomically
      {:ok, lobby} = Gamend.Parties.create_lobby_with_party(user, lobby_attrs)

      # Party leader joins an existing lobby — all members join atomically
      {:ok, lobby} = Gamend.Parties.join_lobby_with_party(user, lobby_id, opts)

  ## PubSub Events

  This module broadcasts the following events:

  - `"party:<party_id>"` topic:
    - `{:party_member_joined, party_id, user_id}`
    - `{:party_member_left, party_id, user_id}`
    - `{:party_disbanded, party_id}`
    - `{:party_updated, party}`


  **Note:** This is an SDK stub. Calling these functions will raise an error.
  The actual implementation runs on the Gamend.
